    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Steps Performed**\n",
    "1. **Loaded datasets from multiple Excel files**:\n",
    "   - `Project1_S25_Questions.xlsx`: Contains survey questions.\n",
    "   - `Project1_S25_14-18_Results.xlsx`: Contains responses from **14-18** age group.\n",
    "   - `Project1_S25_19-40_Results.xlsx`: Contains responses from **19-40** age group.\n",
    "   - `Project1_S25_41_Results.xlsx`: Contains responses from **41+** age group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standardized column names**:\n",
    "   - Converted column names to **lowercase**.\n",
    "   - Replaced **spaces with underscores (`_`)** for uniform formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Checked for missing values and handled them using appropriate imputation techniques**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Created categorical variables for analysis**:\n",
    "   - `fire_experience`: \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on responses related to fire exposure.\n",
    "   - `learning_gains`: \"Yes\" (learned) or \"No\" (did not learn).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merged datasets into `df_combined` and created a backup (`df_backup`)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3.3 Handling Missing Values**\n",
    "- Deleted columns with excessive missing values.\n",
    "- Used **mode imputation** for categorical variables to preserve response trends.\n",
    "- Verified that no missing values remained after preprocessing.\n"
